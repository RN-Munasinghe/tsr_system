# Recognition Model - Traffic Sign Recognition System 
This project presents a real-time traffic sign recognition system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is designed to accurately detect and classify traffic signs based on image coordinates, ensuring robust performance in various environmental conditions.

Features
✅ Recognizes traffic signs using deep learning (CNN).
✅ Works effectively in challenging conditions:

Blurred images
Damaged signs
Rainy weather
✅ Real-time processing capability.
How It Works
Input: The system takes image coordinates of a traffic sign as input.
Processing: The CNN model processes the image and extracts features.
Output: The model classifies and returns the corresponding traffic sign name.
